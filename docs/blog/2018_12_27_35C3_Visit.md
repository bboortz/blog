# My Visit at 35th Chaos Communication Congress (35C3)

The Chaos Communication Congress (C3) is an annual congress for computer entuisasts. 
The congress is about computer security, ethics, policits and a lot more. 
I am attending to the C3 since a couple of years as a normal visitor. This time I want to document this visit a bit.
For me it is not only a congress of workshops and lecutes. I am also enjoying to meet interesting persons.
So that this time I am writing up my expierences at 35C3. 


## Preperation

Normally I dont really prepare for the C3. I just grab all my computer stuff to ensure I have to build something.
This year I will not bring so much stuff to C3 because I want to attend to a few more talks and workshops but also having a bit more discussions.
Very late but hopefully not too late I have submitted a lighning talk. [Click here](https://c3lt.de/35c3/talk/review/7P8FUVWRHMRJNSDTNXHY7XYUNL9AZRFV) to have a look what I have submitted. 
It is currently in the status "submitted" which does mean nothing and unfortunately is the lightning talk schedule full but lets hope..


### Goals

In front of I though about personal goals that I am trying to achive during this C3

1. Writing this blog entry :-)
2. Find a Open Source project I want to contribute to
3. Improving my [Go](https://golang.org/) skills and learn if another programming language fits more to my need personal needs
    * Well, I have continoued the development in go around christmas with this two projects: [highlander-api](https://github.com/bboortz/highlander-api) and [snoop-api](https://github.com/bboortz/snoop-api)
4. Starting the preperation for an talk next year. For sure I have to pass the `Call for Participation`. 
    * At least writing down for my self what is needed for a good talk at C3.
    * The question is what makes a talk awesome?
